# SpaceShmup

**SpaceShmup** is a single-player arcade-style space shooter built with **Unity**.  
The game is inspired by classic shoot-em-up (shmup) games, featuring fast-paced combat, enemy waves, power-ups, shields, and a scrolling space background.

This project was developed as a learning and portfolio project to demonstrate core game development concepts such as object-oriented design, collision handling, UI systems, and gameplay logic.
